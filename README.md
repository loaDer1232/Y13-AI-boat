# AI digi project 2023
## foci and questions
	-ai traning methods    
		-what are the diffrent styles of traning AI  
		-what effect do these diffrent styles have on the way we use AI e.g. resucres intesivity, etc  
		-how does the way we devolpe AI effect the way that we veiw its usage and what problems can this cause   
	-ai to rechaise images and objects  
		-what pioir knowledge whould i need to know to build this   
		-what are the limations of modern solutions   
	-lignistc a  
	-AI ethics  
		-how do we detirmanine if an AI desivervie rights  
		-how do we stop people training AI in a way that is detramental to other people

IBM macine lering department|infomorm the genral public about macine leraning and its applaction in computer vison|IBM is a big player in the devlopment of maccine lering and machine visson so they probaly wouldnt put ther name on a poor report| IBM is a for profit comapy that benifats form the adoption of macine lering and so are biasised|https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning
Recent Developments in Deep Learning for Engineering Applications|A scholarly acrtiacle compaering the diffrent methonds of macine lering and showing there mathmatcal functions and using this absrtct to suggest imporvments| this arctale provides sevral algorthims that can be used to make macine lering as well as functional limations of each|the arctcale is made for schoalrly resharch and there by neglactes the fundmatles|https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning

## final build breif
bulding an AI to sail aboat, this project will require macine vison(identifying bouys) and machine lering(to incress speed and auracy) as well as genaral pathfinding 
machacal conderations will also need to be made for things like scale speed and motor power draw
